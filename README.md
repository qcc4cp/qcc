# Quantum Computing for Programmers

This is the open-source repository for the book [Quantum Computing for Programmers](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/algorithmics-complexity-computer-algebra-and-computational-g/quantum-computing-programmers?format=HB) by Robert Hundt, Cambridge University Press (QCC4CP for short). The book describes this implementation in great detail, including all the underlying math and derivations. Note, however, that this code base is evolving - not all algorithms found here are discussed in the book.

To get started quickly on the Python sources, you may find the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/qcc4cp/qcc/blob/main/resources/quickstart.md) helpful.

This project builds vendor-independent infrastructure from the ground up and implements standard algorithms, such as Quantum Teleportation, Superdense coding, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Quantum Phase estimation (QPE), Grover's Search (with application to Quantum counting, amplitude estimation, Mean and Median estimation, 3SAT, Graph Coloring, and Minimum finding), Quantum random walks, VQE, Max-Cut, Subset-Sum, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Shor's integer factorization, Solovay-Kitaev, Principal Component Analysis, and a few more. It also implements high performance quantum simulation and a transpilation technique to compile circuits to other infrastructures, such as Qiskit or Cirq.

The code is organized as follows:
*  `src` is the main source directory. All algorithms are in this directory.
*  `src/lib` contains the library functions for tensors, states, operators, circuits, and so on, as well as their corresponding tests. All algorithms depend on these library functions.
*  `src/libq` contains the sparse implementation.
*  `src/benchmarks` contains a few benchmarks, as they are mentioned in the book.
*  `resources` contains additional text, sections and chapters.
*  `errata` contains the errata for the book - corrections and clarifications.
*  `external` contains the *.BUILD files to point `bazel` to `python` and `numpy`.

## Installation

There are several ways to get started on this code base:

*   Instructions for a **Python-only**, minimal setup can be found [here](https://github.com/qcc4cp/qcc/blob/main/resources/quickstart.md#setup).
*   If you have access to **Docker**, the corresponding simple instructions are [here](resources/README.Docker.md)
*   Manual installation on **Linux** (Debian / Ubuntu) are [here](resources/README.Linux.md)
*   For **MacOS**, see [README.MacOS.md](resources/README.MacOS.md).
*   For **Windows** (partially supported), see [README.Windows.md](resources/README.Windows.md).
*   For interactive **SageMath**, see [README.SageMath.md](resources/README.SageMath.md).
*   **CentOS** is also supported (see [README.CentOS.md](resources/README.CentOS.md)).


## Run

The main algorithms are all in `src`.
To run individual algorithms, run any of these command lines. To run a Python file with `bazel`, run `bazel run python-file` but omit the `.py` extensions (for example `bazel run arith_classic`. PYTHONPATH must point to the root directory:

```

   python3 state_prep_mottonen

```

To test aspects of the sparse implementation:
```
  cd src/libq
  bazel test ...
```

To run the benchmarks:

```
  cd src/benchmarks
  bazel run larose_benchmark
  bazel run tensor_math
```

## Transpilation

To experiment with transpilation, a few things must work together:
   * Specify a target output. For example, to generate a `libq` C++ file, use `--libq=./test.cc`

   * The code should only contain a single `circuit.qc()`-generated circuit. This circuit will not
     be eagerly executed. Instead, all gates and qubits will be collected in an internal IR.

   * There must be a single call to `qc.dump_to_file()`. The circuit as that point
     will be transpiled to the target platform (an example of this can be found in
     `order_finding.py`).

For the given example, the generated file `test.cc` can be compiled and linked with `libq`
with a command-line similar to this one:
```
$ cd qcc/src
$ cc -O2 -Ilibq test.cc libq/qureg.cc libq/apply.cc libq/gates.cc -o a.out -lc++
$ a.out
```
